{-| A `Rope` is similar to a list, but has fast (constant time) concatenation at both ends, and fast concatenation of two `Rope`s.

It's slightly slower (O(n + operations) instead of O(n)) to iterate through, so you should convert it to a `List` if you plan to use it repeatedly.

Internally the `Rope` is a tree of lists.

type alias Rope a =
    Internal.Rope a



-- CREATE


{-| An empty rope.
-}
empty : Rope a
empty =
    Leaf []


{-| Create a rope with only one element:

    singleton 1234 |> toList
    --> [ 1234 ]

    singleton "hi" |> toList
    --> [ "hi" ]

-}
singleton : a -> Rope a
singleton value =
    Leaf [ value ]


{-| Add an element to the front of a list.

    prepend 1 (fromList [2,3]) |> toList
    --> [1,2,3]
    prepend 1 empty |> toList
    --> [1]

Complexity: O(1)

-}
prepend : a -> Rope a -> Rope a
prepend head tail =
    case tail of
        Leaf list ->
            Leaf (head :: list)

        Node ropes ->
            Node (Leaf [ head ] :: ropes)


{-| Add an element to the end of a list.

    append 1 (fromList [2,3]) |> toList
    --> [2,3,1]
    append 1 empty |> toList
    --> [1]

Complexity: O(1)

-}
append : a -> Rope a -> Rope a
append last init =
    Node [ init, Leaf [ last ] ]


{-| Build a rope from a list.

Complexity: O(1)

-}
fromList : List a -> Rope a
fromList list =
    Leaf list



-- TRANSFORM


{-| Apply a function to every element of a rope.

    map sqrt (fromList [1,4,9]) |> toList
    --> [1,2,3]

    map not (fromList [True,False,True]) |> toList
    --> [False,True,False]

So `map func (fromList [ a, b, c ])` is the same as `fromList [ func a, func b, func c ]`

Complexity: O(n)

-}
map : (a -> b) -> Rope a -> Rope b
map f rope =
    rope
        |> foldl (\e acc -> f e :: acc) []
        |> List.reverse
        |> Leaf


{-| Same as `map` but the function is also applied to the index of each
element (starting at zero).

    indexedMap Tuple.pair (fromList [ "Tom", "Sue", "Bob" ]) |> toList
    --> [ ( 0, "Tom" ), ( 1, "Sue" ), ( 2, "Bob" ) ]

Complexity: O(n)

-}
indexedMap : (Int -> a -> b) -> Rope a -> Rope b
indexedMap f rope =
    rope
        |> foldl (\e ( i, acc ) -> ( i + 1, f i e :: acc )) ( 0, [] )
        |> Tuple.second
        |> List.reverse
        |> Leaf


{-| Reduce a rope from the left.

    foldl (+) 0 (fromList [ 1, 2, 3 ])
    --> 6

    foldl (::) [] (fromList [ 1, 2, 3 ])
    --> [ 3, 2, 1 ]

So `foldl step state [1,2,3]` is like saying:

    state
        |> step 1

        |> step 3

Complexity: O(n)

{-| Reduce a rope from the right.

    --> 6

    foldr (::) [] (fromList [ 1, 2, 3 ])
    --> [ 1, 2, 3 ]

So `foldr step state [1,2,3]` is like saying:
